- "Horizontal" with integrated OBD2 connector. This is especially for some cars where a wider casing will prevent you from plugging it into the cars jack if the jack is slightly recessed.  
  
- I've also made a version with a slot for a built in SD card reader. Good for logging locally within the unit instead of over Bluetooth/Wifi/USB. This one is identical in size.

- "Vertical" with integrated OBD2 connector. Flatter, doesn't stick out as long from the jack as the "Horizontal" version but is wider so will not fit in all cars.
