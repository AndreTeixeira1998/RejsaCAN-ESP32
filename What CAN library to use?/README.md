There are many CAN libraries that work with the ESP32, here are the ones I've found so far. Each library comes with their own set of code examples, my tip is to check these out to help you decide if you are thinking about an ESP32 based CAN project.

If you only want to access OBD2 data and not dive into the lower layer CAN bus this is also available:

I'm sure there are more libraries out there. If you find something that has some special advantage feel free to email me so I can add it here
