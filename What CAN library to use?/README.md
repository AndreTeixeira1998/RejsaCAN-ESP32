There are many CAN libraries that work with the ESP32, here are the ones I've found so far. If you are thinking about an ESP32 based CAN project my tip is to check out the examples included with each library, they will give you some idea on different approaches.

If you only want to access OBD2 data and not dive into the lower layer CAN bus this is also available:

I'm sure there are more libraries out there. If you find something that has some special advantage feel free to email me so I can add it here
